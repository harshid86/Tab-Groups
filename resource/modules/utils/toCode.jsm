// toCode - object that allows me to modify a function quickly from within my scripts, being able to revert afterwards and control for any errors in the process.
// USE WITH CAUTION! It's not 100% failsafe.
// Warning: At least for now it doesn't clean up after itself, I have to do this manually in each script unload.
// Warning: Don't modify twice the same method within the same add-on using more than one declaration to toCode.modify(), it doesn't check for repeated changed functions.
//	modify(aObj, aName, aArray) - modify the method with the changes included in aArray
//		aObj - (obj) object that contains the method to be changed
//		aName - (str) name of the method to be changed, including the objects name, in the form of "aObj.aMethod"
//		params - (array) [ [original, new] x n ], where new replaces original in the modified function
//	revert(aObj, aName) - reverts any changes made to aName in aObj by restoring a saved original. Controls for unforeseen errors and further changes to the method by other add-ons.
//		see modify()
// Note to self, by using the Function() method to create functions I'm priving them from their original context,
// that is, while inside a function created by that method in a module loaded by Modules I can't call 'subObj' (as in 'mainObj.subObj') by itself as I normally do,
// I have to either use 'mainObj.subObj' or 'this.subObj'; I try to avoid this as that is how I'm building my modularized add-ons, so I'm using eval, at least for now until I find a
// better way to implement this functionality.
// Note: try to hardcode everything in the strings to replace, as it's difficult to backtrace variables in them to ensure they are safe to use. This is a big issue for AMO reviewers
// who are not familiar with the code, so not even objName or objPathString!
// Don't forget that in bootstraped add-ons, these modified functions take the context of the modifier (sandboxed).
